# TypeColor

# TypeColor is a game developed in Python with tkinter.

# Abstract
* TypeColor is a game which can be played on electronic devices such as Mobile, PC, Laptop's, that is on screens or can be played on Hardware devices that is of 8051 Microcontroller. 
* In this game, the main aim is to guess the color of the word & to type it, instead of typing the word itself.
* When starting with this game one has to write the color of the word in the space provided in the text box, instead of the word. 
* This is the most simple & easy in use & in playing a game for all type of users, especially for kids. 

# How To Play
* In the back-end my logic has been implemented to run the game smoothly.
* On the screen player will see 'Press Enter' then after pressing, the game starts.
* The task of the player will be to guess the correct color of any words & not the word itself,& type that color in the textbox present there.
* If the guessed color is right then both score & timer will be incremented.
* But if the player guesses wrong color then no score will be increased, & time will be flying on a regular basis.
* The game ends when time becomes zero seconds.
* Thus to play for a longer time the player needs to always keep the state of time in his mind & guess the color right, type fast, & make
your score high & beat others.
